They are placed in trash cans for recycling. Such medical wastes are generally disposed of in a centralized and harmless manner, including incineration, destructive disinfection, and deep burial after incineration. When using a safety box for incineration, the temperature should be above 800 \u00b0C to reduce air pollution; if there is no safety box, a lower incinerator with a temperature (300 \u00b0 C ~ 400 \u00b0 C) can also be used. In areas where there are no destroyers and incinerators, the method of deep burying after incineration can be used.<\/p>\n<p>Here, we must remind everyone that disposable syringes should not be recycled at will. Some disposable medicines will have some residual medicines that are not cleaned, so be sure to pay attention to them. You can&#8217;t ignore them. not allowed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"product-attributes-item\">\n<ul>\n<li><label>Brand\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">None<\/span><\/li>\n<li><label>Product origin\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">Made in China<\/span><\/li>\n<li><label>Delivery time\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">According to quantity<\/span><\/li>\n<li><label>Supply capacity\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">1,000,000pcs\/month<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"product-overview\">\n<p>*Disposable syringes<br \/>\n*Disposable infusion sets<br \/>\n*transfusion sets<br \/>\n*Scalp vein set<br \/>\nOur company was certified by CFDA, CE, ISO13485 and ISO9001, approved by GMP .<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":6525,"template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/cosmetictradingbv.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product\/6514"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/cosmetictradingbv.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/cosmetictradingbv.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/product"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/cosmetictradingbv.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/6525"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/cosmetictradingbv.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6514"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
