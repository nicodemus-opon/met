Excellent chemical resistance, acid, alkali and oil resistance. Has strong tensile strength, puncture resistance, and is not easy to break. It has good sealing performance and effectively prevents dust from being emitted outward. It has no silicon content and has certain antistatic properties, which is suitable for the production needs of the electronics industry. Comfortable to wear, long-term wear will not cause skin tension, which is conducive to blood circulation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Features of nitrile gloves:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nitrile test gloves can be worn on both right and left hands, made of 100% nitrile latex, free of protein, effectively avoiding protein allergy; main performance is puncture resistance, oil resistance and solvent resistance; hemp surface treatment, avoiding the falling of utensils during use High tensile strength avoids tearing when worn; it is easy to wear after powder-free treatment, effectively avoiding skin allergies caused by powder.
