Catheters are medical devices that can be inserted in the body to treat diseases or perform a surgical procedure. By modifying the material or adjusting the way catheters are manufactured, it is possible to tailor catheters for cardiovascular, urological, gastrointestinal, neurovascular, and ophthalmic applications.<\/p>\n<p>Catheters can be inserted into a body cavity, duct, or vessel. Functionally, they allow drainage, administration of fluids or gases, access by surgical instruments, and also perform a wide variety of other tasks depending on the type of catheter.[1] The process of inserting a catheter is \u201ccatheterization\u201d. In most uses, a catheter is a thin, flexible tube (\u201csoft\u201d catheter) though catheters are available in varying levels of stiffness depending on the application. A catheter left inside the body, either temporarily or permanently, may be referred to as an \u201cindwelling catheter\u201d (for example, a peripherally inserted central catheter). A permanently inserted catheter may be referred to as a \u201cpermcath\u201d (originally a trademark).<\/p>\n<p>The catheter used for hemodialysis is a tunneled catheter because it is placed under the skin. There are two types of tunneled catheters: cuffed or non-cuffed. Non-cuffed tunneled catheters are used for emergencies and for short periods (up to 3 weeks). Tunneled cuffed catheters, a type recommended by the NKF for temporary access, can be used for longer than 3 weeks when: \u2013 An AV fistula or graft has been placed but is not yet ready for use.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In medicine, a catheter is a thin tube made from medical grade materials serving a broad range of functions.
