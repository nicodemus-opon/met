The unique needle design makes it not cut tissue and nerve needle during puncture, but squeeze and separate needle. The puncture needle will naturally close under the elastic packing of the tissue, and the recovery speed is greater than other types of needles, greatly reducing Tissue damage.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div class=\"product-attributes-item\">\n<ul>\n<li><label>Brand\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">None<\/span><\/li>\n<li><label>Product origin\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">Made in China<\/span><\/li>\n<li><label>Delivery time\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">According to quantity<\/span><\/li>\n<li><label>Supply capacity\u00a0<\/label><span class=\"info-deta\">1,000,000pcs\/month<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"product-overview\">\n<p>Single-use Spinal Needle<br \/>\n1.
