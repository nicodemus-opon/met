The blood glucose meter then uses an algorithm to work out the blood glucose level based upon the difference in current.<\/p>\n<p>Some blood glucose test strips allow the reapplication of more blood to the same test strip if needed during the test. The amount of blood required by a test strip can vary between manufacturers.
